# This program reads in a list of states, their EVs, and the mean and std dev of their departure from natl vote
#  These departures are uncorrelated.  The user specifies the noise level.
# The program generates a large number of state departure sets.  For each set, the program
# calculates (for each h value) the national vote that would generate a toss-up = Vustu.
# It then simulates elections around that toss-up, to determine the fraction of elections for each h
# that would generate a "missed election" - incorrect national outcome for the supplied noise
#    The outputs (by h value) are the mean toss-up vote, and the fraction of elections won by the wrong
#    candidate (both at a given distance from the toss-up, and integrated over the competitive range)
#  The integrations are done for both a uniform distro for the national vote, and a peaked distribution
# Note: all my code expresses Vi in terms of Dem's share, while paper uses GOP as candidate 1
